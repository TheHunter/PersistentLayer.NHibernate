    <description>PersistentLayer is an easy Component that exposes a set of Contracts (interfaces) wich defines rules for persisting / retrieving application data from data storages, and Its implementation depends exclusively by the underlaying  architecture like an ORM (NHibernate. Entity Framework, ORMLite ecc.) or maybe by another kind of systems like NoSQL storages.</description>
    <summary>PersistentLayer is a layered architecture which contains a set of Contracts(Interfaces) responsable for persisting application data to and retrieving it from one or many data stores.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>In old versions, this component implemented NHibernate, now instead this components contains exclusively interfaces an some concreted base classes, in order to define generic policies for making CRUD operations by underlaying implementations.
In order for using this component with NHibernate implementation, you must to download the package "PersistentLayer.NHibernate", which is the implementation of PersistentLayer using NHibernate.
